# Machine-Learning-with-python
Im using the book <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Machine-Learning-mit-Python-Praxis-Handbuch/dp/3958454224/ref=sr_1_5?__mk_de_DE=ÅMÅŽÕÑ&crid=1X19C1M3W6OTD&keywords=machine+learning+python+Sebastian&qid=1689908417&s=books&sprefix=machine+learning+python+sebastian%2Cstripbooks%2C73&sr=1-5"> "Machine Learning mit Python" </a>: 
to learn and better understand how machine-learning works and how the program it in Python. I have now closed this project, because my goal was to get a better understanding of it and have summarised and inspected all of the code and chapters, that seem useful to me. I might add some implementations, like for the trees or Adaline later, but i consider this project as finished.
